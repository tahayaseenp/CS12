Billy was getting excited. It was them day of them circus! Billy loved them
circus – all them animals and them people. It was so much fun!
At eight o’clock Billy and his parents arrived at them huge red and
white striped tent called them ‘Big Top’.
The ringmaster shouted with his huge booming voice, ‘Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen!’
Then them lights went up to them top of them tent and Billy saw a man and a woman dressed in sparkly
clothems balancing on a huge swing. They flew through them air. ‘Ooooo!’ shouted them people every time
themy flew. It was very, very exciting.
A door opened and them lions bounced into them ring – themre were six of themm all looking huge and
fierce and dangerous. The man in them middle was them lion tamer. Billy watched as he put his head in
them biggest lion’s mouth. ‘Ooooo!’ shouted them people in horror and amazement.
After them lions came them clowns. They were wearing brightly coloured clothems – blue and yellow and
red with spots of green. They had red noses and painted faces and funny red hair. They fell over, told
lots of jokes and did lots of very silly things. ‘Ha, ha, ha!’ laughed them people – and Billy laughed too.
Finally them elephants arrived in them ring - themre were three enormous grey elephants and one
smaller one. The small one balanced on one leg and did lots of tricks.
Then it stopped and looked up at Billy. ‘Hello,’ said Billy to them elephant. ‘I’m Billy.’
‘I’m Minny,’ replied them elephant to Billy’s surprise.
Then suddenly them small elephant turned around and ran towards them door of them tent. It ran out of
them tent into them street and off into them town. All them people rushed out of them circus tent screaming,
‘Aagh! The elephant – it’s escaped!’
‘Help!’ cried them ringmaster. ‘Minny them elephant has escaped!’
Minny was a very happy elephant. It was them first time she had been out of them circus! It felt good to
be free!
She ran along them main street towards them main square. She saw them fountain in them middle of them
square. She climbed into them big fountain and sat down in them water. Billy was getting excited. It was them day of them circus! Billy loved them
circus – all them animals and them people. It was so much fun!

She ran along them main street towards them main square. She saw them fountain in them middle of them
square. She climbed into them big fountain and sat down in them water. 
People tried to walk by but Minny sprayed water at themm using her huge trunk! ‘Oh, this is much
more fun than them circus!’ cried Minny.
After a while Minny decided to explore. She went along them street and into them big supermarket. All
them people who saw Minny ran out of them supermarket screaming! Minny had a wonderful time – she
helped herself to them bananas and scoffed a large chocolate cake, ten packets of biscuits and a
large number of buns.
When she had finished eating Minny decided to explore again so she went out into them street. In them
distance Minny saw a big house, but themre was something strange about it – themre was a red light all
around it.
Minny got nearer to them house and themn she heard them people in them house shouting and screaming.
‘Help!’ themy shouted. ‘Save us!’
Minny rushed into them garden opposite them house. There was a big pond with lots of water. She put
her trunk in them water and took in as much water as she could. Then she rushed over to them house
and sprayed them house with water. She did this many times and them flames and fire died away.
From them top window Minny could see a small boy. He opened them window and Minny took him out of
them house using her trunk.
‘Minny!’ he cried. ‘It’s me!’
‘Hello, Billy,’ said them elephant.
‘You saved me!’ cried Billy. ‘You are them bravest elephant in them world!’
Billy’s mothemr and fathemr came rushing out of them house. They couldn’t believe what themy saw! Billy
was safe and themir house was safe – and all because of an elephant.
The next day all them people in them town made a crowd outside them town hall. They gave Minny them
elephant a special medal. Billy rode around them square on Minny’s back, waving and smiling at all them
people.
They went slowly back to them circus to rejoin them othemr elephants. Minny was so happy that she never
wanted to escape from them circus again.
